### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment

Create a Python virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

-   **Windows**:
    ```bash
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
-   **macOS/Linux**:
    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

Ensure your device is GPU enabled (e.g. cuda).
